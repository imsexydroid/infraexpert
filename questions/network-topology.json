The topology should be designed to ensure\n    optimal performance, security, and availability.</p>\n<p>From host to internet, a typical network topology may include the following\n    components:</p>\n<p>Access layer: This is the point of entry for all users and devices connecting\n    to the network. It includes switches and access points that provide\n    connectivity to end users.</p>\n<p>Distribution layer: This layer is responsible for segmenting the network and\n    providing security measures such as firewalls and VLANs. It also includes\n    routers that provide routing and traffic management.</p>\n<p>Core layer: This is the backbone of the network and is responsible for\n    high-speed data transfer between the different segments of the network. It\n    includes high-speed switches and routers that provide redundant connections\n    and high-speed data transfer.</p>\n<p>To ensure optimal performance, the network topology should be designed to\n    provide redundancy and to minimize the impact of any failures. This can be\n    achieved through the use of redundant components such as redundant routers,\n    switches, and links, as well as by implementing protocols such as OSPF and\n    BGP for routing.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure optimal security, the network should be segmented to limit the\n    scope of any potential security breaches, by using techniques such as VLANs,\n    subnets, and firewall rules. Security measures such as encryption, VPN, and\n    intrusion detection/prevention systems should be implemented to protect the\n    network from external threats.</p>\n<p>Some general guidelines:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Use two public subnets and pairs of private subnets.</li>\n    <li>There should be no unnecessary hop between Availability Zones.</li>\n    <li>Must use service discovery to avoid outdated address configurations.</li>\n    <li>Use strict architecture layering rules. Lower layer of networking stack\n        shouldn\u2019t block on higher layer of networking stack.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To ensure optimal availability, the network topology should include a\n    management and monitoring system to ensure that the network is running\n    optimally and that any issues are identified and addressed quickly. This can\n    be done by using monitoring tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, or Datadog, which\n    can alert you to any issues with your network devices.</p>\n<p>To ensure compliance, the network topology should be designed to comply with\n    any relevant regulations and standards, such as HIPAA, to\n    ensure that the network is secure and compliant.</p>"

OSPF is typically used in\n    smaller networks, while BGP is used in large networks.\n</p>\n\n<p>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is typically used in smaller networks because it is a link state routing protocol that is designed to work well in a limited area of network coverage, such as a single organization or a campus network. It is easy to configure and manage, and it can quickly adapt to changes in network topology. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is used in large networks, such as internet service provider (ISP) networks, because it is a path vector routing protocol that can handle complex routing decisions based on attributes such as policy, network reachability, and performance. BGP is more scalable and flexible than OSPF, making it well-suited for use in large, heterogeneous networks where routing policies are subject to change. </p>\n<p>In summary, the choice between OSPF and BGP depends on the size and complexity of the network, and the routing requirements of the organization.
